# Project Constitution

This document is the stable charter for the personal single‑page site. It captures enduring principles, quality bars, and change governance. Tactical “how to prompt Copilot” rules live in `copilot-instructions.md`.

---
## 1. Mission
Provide a fast, elegant, accessible, zero‑build personal presence page with minimal maintenance overhead.

## 2. Scope & Non‑Goals
In Scope:
- Single HTML document + one CSS file (+ favicon, fonts, minor inline SVG assets).
- Tiny progressive enhancement JavaScript limited to theme toggling / light UX sugar.

Out of Scope / Non‑Goals:
- Client frameworks (React/Vue/etc.).
- Bundlers, transpilers, pipeline complexity.
- Tracking / analytics scripts.
- Heavy animation or canvas/WebGL flourishes.
- Server code or dynamic backends.

## 3. Design Principles
1. Clarity > cleverness (readable semantic HTML, descriptive class & aria labels).
2. Progressive enhancement: page fully usable without JavaScript.
3. Performance first: less bytes beats more features; limit network requests.
4. Accessibility is not optional (WCAG AA target for contrast & focus indicators).
5. Deterministic simplicity: no hidden build steps; source = deployed artifact.
6. Tokenized design: color, spacing, typography via CSS custom properties.
7. Consistent aesthetic: refined, quiet, minimal—avoid visual noise.

## 4. Architecture & Structure
Single layer with *content*, *presentation*, and *very light behavior* kept conceptually distinct:
- `index.html`: semantic structure + metadata.
- `layout.css`: layout, responsive, state styles.
- `themes/deco.css`: design tokens and theme-specific styling.
- Inline `<script>`: only feature: theme toggle (dark/light). Future JS must justify itself inline with a comment referencing this constitution (e.g., `// Allowed: progressive enhancement – reason:`).

### Layer Boundaries / Rules
- HTML must remain semantic (no purely decorative `<div>` wrappers without class purpose).
- JS MUST NOT block initial rendering (keep inline, tiny, after critical markup; no external JS files unless <2KB and well‑justified).
- Fonts use a local/system stack to eliminate third‑party dependencies; future optimization: consider self‑hosting only if needed.

## 5. Performance Budgets
| Artifact | Budget (uncompressed) | Notes |
|----------|-----------------------|-------|
| `index.html` | ≤ 60 KB | Currently well below; avoid inline bloat. |
| `layout.css` | ≤ 20 KB | Keep layout tidy; minimal responsive adjustments. |
| `themes/deco.css` | ≤ 15 KB | Theme tokens and component styles. |
| JS (inline) | ≤ 4 KB | Only enhancement; no libraries. |
| Requests (initial) | ≤ 8 | HTML + CSS + favicon + fonts*. |

*Font count may be reduced later by trimming weights.

## 6. Accessibility Standards
- Visible focus always (custom ring already implemented).
- Provide `aria-label` where link text alone is ambiguous (e.g., icon-only future buttons).
- Maintain contrast ≥ 4.5:1 normal text, 3:1 large text.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`: no essential info conveyed only via motion.
- Landmarks: keep primary content in `<main>`; navigation elements labeled.

## 7. Theming & Tokens
All theming defined in `:root` (+ `[data-theme]` overrides) using CSS custom properties. Allowed changes:
- Add new tokens only if reused ≥2 times.
- Dark theme parity required for new color tokens.
- No hard‑coded hex values outside token definitions (except temporary experimentation with a `TODO:` comment).

## 8. Security & Privacy
- No third‑party analytics or trackers.
- No inline user‑submitted content (XSS surface is effectively none—keep it that way).
- Avoid leaking unnecessary referrer data (use `rel="noopener noreferrer"` on external links — already enforced).

## 9. Governance / Change Process
| Change Type | Requirement |
|-------------|-------------|
| Content text tweak | Direct commit acceptable |
| Style token addition | Brief rationale in commit message |
| New JS feature | Justify with comment + keep under budget |
| Performance budget increase | Update table + rationale section |
| Constitution change | PR labeled `constitution-change` |

A constitution change should: (a) state the problem, (b) list options, (c) justify chosen adjustment.

## 10. Anti‑Patterns (Disallowed)
- Adding a framework or build system “just because”.
- Inlining large base64 images.
- Adding more than minimal JS state management (no global reactive systems).
- Excessive box‑shadows / layered glows that reduce legibility.
- Hard‑coding duplicated color literals instead of a token.

## 11. Future Considerations (Optional Backlog)
- Self‑host fonts (subsetting for smaller CLS + privacy).
- Add `link rel=preload` for critical font files if self‑hosted.
- Introduce automated HTML/CSS validation in CI (if CI is ever added).
- Generate a static screenshot preview image for social sharing (`og:image`).

## 12. Glossary
- Token: A named design variable (CSS custom property) controlling a visual primitive.
- Progressive Enhancement: Baseline experience functions without JS; JS enriches but is not required.
- Budget: A soft upper limit; exceeding must be explicitly justified.

## 13. CHANGELOG
- 2025-11-05: Initial constitution created.

Amend responsibly. Keep this file concise; high churn suggests misplaced content (move implementation details to `copilot-instructions.md`).
